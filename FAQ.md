# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Social Flood API?

Social Flood API is a comprehensive REST API that provides access to Google services including News, Trends, Autocomplete, and YouTube Transcripts. It offers developers a unified interface to access multiple Google data sources with consistent authentication and rate limiting.

### How do I get started?

1. Sign up for an API key at [our website](https://socialflood.com)
2. Review the [API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md) for available endpoints
3. Check out the [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) for sample code
4. Start with the [Quick Start Guide](README.md#quick-start)

### What programming languages are supported?

The API is language-agnostic and works with any HTTP client. We provide official SDKs for:

- Python
- JavaScript/Node.js
- Go (coming soon)

## Authentication & Security

### How do I authenticate my requests?

All API requests require an API key in the header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Is my data secure?

Yes, we implement multiple security measures:

- All data is transmitted over HTTPS
- API keys are encrypted and stored securely
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits

### What happens if I lose my API key?

Contact our support team immediately at [support@socialflood.com](mailto:support@socialflood.com). We'll help you revoke the old key and generate a new one.

## Usage & Limits

### What are the rate limits?

- Free tier: 1,000 requests/day
- Basic tier: 10,000 requests/day
- Pro tier: 100,000 requests/day
- Enterprise: Custom limits

Rate limits reset daily at midnight UTC.

### How do I check my usage?

You can check your usage statistics through:

- API response headers (`X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`)
- Dashboard at [socialflood.com/dashboard](https://socialflood.com/dashboard)
- Programmatic access via the `/usage` endpoint

### Can I upgrade my plan?

Yes! You can upgrade your plan at any time through your dashboard. Changes take effect immediately, and you'll be prorated for the billing period.

## API Endpoints

### Google News API

#### Why am I getting empty results for news searches?

This could be due to:

- The search query is too specific or contains restricted terms
- Geographic restrictions on certain topics
- The news source has blocked automated access
- Try broadening your search terms or using different parameters

#### How fresh is the news data?

Our news data is typically 5-15 minutes old, depending on the source and topic popularity.

### Google Trends API

#### What's the difference between interest_over_time and interest_by_region?

- `interest_over_time`: Shows how search interest changes over time
- `interest_by_region`: Shows geographic distribution of search interest

#### Why do some trends return no data?

Google Trends data may not be available for:

- Very recent time periods (data takes time to process)
- Niche or low-volume search terms
- Restricted or sensitive topics

### Google Autocomplete API

#### How does the variations parameter work?

When `variations=true`, the API generates multiple autocomplete suggestions for your query, providing broader coverage of related search terms.

#### Why am I getting fewer results than expected?

Autocomplete results depend on:

- The popularity of the search term
- Current search trends
- Geographic location settings
- Google's algorithm updates

### YouTube Transcripts API

#### What languages are supported for transcripts?

We support all languages that YouTube provides transcripts for. The API automatically detects the available languages for each video.

#### Why can't I get transcripts for some videos?

Transcripts may not be available because:

- The video creator disabled transcripts
- The video contains copyrighted music
- The video is too new (transcripts take time to generate)
- The video is age-restricted

## Technical Issues

### I'm getting 429 (Too Many Requests) errors

You've exceeded your rate limit. Check the response headers for reset timing:

```http
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

### Connection timeouts

If you're experiencing timeouts:

- Increase your client timeout settings
- Check your internet connection
- Try using a different region endpoint
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Invalid API key errors

Common causes:

- Typo in your API key
- Using an expired or revoked key
- Missing the "Bearer " prefix
- Using the wrong header name

## Billing & Pricing

### How does billing work?

We bill monthly based on your plan tier. Usage is tracked in real-time, and you can monitor it through your dashboard.

### Can I get a refund?

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all paid plans. Contact support within 30 days of your first payment.

### Do you offer enterprise discounts?

Yes! Contact our sales team at [enterprise@socialflood.com](mailto:enterprise@socialflood.com) for custom pricing and features.

## Development & Integration

### Do you provide webhooks?

Not currently, but it's on our roadmap. For now, you can poll our endpoints or use our real-time streaming API (available in Pro tier).

### Can I use this for commercial applications?

Yes, all plans include commercial usage rights. Review our [Terms of Service](https://socialflood.com/terms) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### My requests are slow

Performance optimization tips:

- Use caching for frequently requested data
- Implement connection pooling
- Use the nearest regional endpoint
- Batch requests when possible
- Check our [Performance Tuning](PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md) guide

### Data seems outdated

- News data: Typically 5-15 minutes old
- Trends data: Usually 1-2 hours old
- Autocomplete: Real-time
- Transcripts: Available immediately when YouTube generates them

### Getting 500 Internal Server Error

This usually indicates a temporary server issue. Try:

- Checking our [status page](https://status.socialflood.com)

## Legal & Compliance

### Can I store the data I retrieve?

Yes, but you must comply with Google's Terms of Service and our API terms. Some data may have additional restrictions.

### Do you comply with GDPR?

Yes, we are GDPR compliant. We don't store personal data unless required for billing, and we provide data export/deletion upon request.

### What's your data retention policy?

We don't retain API request/response data. Usage statistics are kept for billing purposes only and are automatically deleted after 2 years.
