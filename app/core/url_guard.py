"""
Outbound URL validation (SSRF defence).

Every place where this application fetches a URL supplied by a caller must run
it through :func:`validate_outbound_url` first. Two such sinks exist:

* ``google_news_api`` ``/article-details/?url=`` -- server-side article fetch.
* ``google_maps_service`` place lookup -- Playwright ``page.goto()``.

Both previously accepted any string, which made them a server-side request
forgery (SSRF) primitive: the caller chooses what the server connects to,
inside the container network, and gets the response body back.

Design
------
Defence is layered, because each layer alone is bypassable:

1. **Scheme + host allow-list.** Only ``https`` (``http`` opt-in) and only
   hosts the application actually has a reason to fetch. An allow-list is used
   rather than a private-IP deny-list because a deny-list must enumerate every
   internal range correctly, forever, and gets it wrong the first time someone
   adds IPv6 or a new cloud metadata address.

2. **DNS resolution check.** A host-name check alone is not enough: an
   attacker who controls ``evil.example.com`` can point it at ``127.0.0.1`` or
   at the cloud metadata address ``169.254.169.254``. Every address the host
   resolves to must be globally routable.

3. **IP pinning.** Between validation and the actual request, a hostile DNS
   server can change its answer from a public address to a private one (DNS
   rebinding). :func:`validate_outbound_url` therefore returns the addresses it
   validated so the caller can pin the connection to them.

Error handling
--------------
:class:`UrlNotAllowed` carries two messages: ``reason`` (detailed, for server
logs) and ``public_message`` (generic, for the HTTP response). Never put
``reason`` in a response body. Distinguishable failures -- "connection
refused" vs "timed out" vs "DNS failure" -- turn a blocked endpoint back into
an internal port-scan oracle, which is precisely how the News endpoint
behaved before this module existed.
