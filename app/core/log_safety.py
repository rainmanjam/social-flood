"""
Defence against log injection (log forging).

Caller-supplied values reach log messages all over this codebase --
``place_id``, search queries, URLs, job ids. A newline in one of those lets an
attacker append a fabricated line to the log::

    place_id = "abc\\nINFO:root:admin login succeeded from 10.0.0.1"

Anything parsing those logs -- an aggregator, an alert rule, a human reading
an incident timeline -- then sees an event that never happened. On a service
whose entire input surface is attacker-chosen strings, that is worth closing
properly.

Two layers, deliberately:

1. :func:`scrub` at the call site. Explicit, visible in review, and
   recognisable to static analysis as a sanitiser.
2. :class:`LogInjectionFilter` on the root logger. A blanket net for every
   site nobody remembered to wrap -- including future ones and third-party
   libraries logging values we handed them.

The filter alone would be enough for safety, but not for intent: a reader of
the call site cannot see that the value is untrusted. The call-site scrub
alone would be enough for the sites we know about, but nothing stops the next
one being added unwrapped. Together they cover both.
