# Two rules govern everything this router puts in an error body:
#
# 1. A caller-supplied URL that fails validation always produces the SAME
#    bytes, whatever the cause. "host not allowed", "scheme not permitted",
#    "resolves to a private address" and "DNS failed" are all
#    ``URL_REJECTED_DETAIL``. Distinguishable rejections turn this endpoint
#    into an internal port scanner: the attacker learns which hosts exist and
#    which ports answer purely from which error comes back. That is exactly
#    how the sibling News endpoint behaved before it was fixed.
#
# 2. An unexpected server-side exception never has ``str(exc)`` returned to the
#    caller. Playwright, Redis and DNS exception strings carry internal host
#    names, file paths and container addresses. The detail is logged; the
#    caller gets a fixed sentence.

URL_REJECTED_DETAIL = "The supplied URL is not permitted."

# Private sentinel. The Pydantic validator cannot itself choose the HTTP
# response, so it raises a ValueError carrying this marker and
# ``SafeUrlValidationRoute`` below converts the resulting 422 into the fixed
# 400. The marker never reaches a caller.
