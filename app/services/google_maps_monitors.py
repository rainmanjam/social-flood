"""
Place monitors and outbound webhooks for the Google Maps module.

This module replaces the previous fabricated monitor/webhook endpoints. Those
returned ``status: "active"`` for a monitor that was never stored (a subsequent
GET on the returned id 404'd), and a webhook id that never delivered anything.
Everything here is backed by :mod:`app.services.record_store`, so a record that
is reported as created can afterwards be read back, and a webhook that is
reported as registered is actually delivered to.

Three concerns live here:

**Storage.** Monitors live in the ``maps:monitors`` namespace and webhooks in
``maps:webhooks``, both owner-scoped by :func:`owner_id_for_api_key`. Owner
scoping is enforced by the store's key layout rather than by filtering after a
read, so one caller cannot address another caller's monitor at all.

**The scheduler.** ``record_store`` deliberately exposes no "list every owner's
records" method -- that absence is the whole point of the module. The scheduler
nevertheless has to find work across owners, so this module maintains an
explicit owner index: a separate namespace whose single synthetic owner
(:data:`_INDEX_OWNER`) holds one record per real owner that has ever created a
monitor. Enumerating owners is therefore a deliberate, auditable act against a
dedicated index rather than a hole punched in the store's scoping.

**Delivery.** A webhook target is a caller-supplied outbound URL, i.e. exactly
the SSRF sink class :mod:`app.core.url_guard` exists for. It is validated at
registration *and* again before every delivery -- a name that resolved to a
public address at registration can be repointed at ``169.254.169.254`` later,
so a registration-time-only check is a rebinding window measured in days.
Redirects are never followed blindly: the ``Location`` of a 3xx is re-validated
under the same policy before the hop is taken.

Deliveries are signed with HMAC-SHA256 over the exact request body so a
receiver can verify the payload came from us, and retried with exponential
backoff up to a bounded attempt count. Every attempt's outcome is recorded on
the webhook record, which is what lets ``list_webhooks`` report real health
instead of an invented ``"active"``.
