"""
Owner-scoped, durable record storage for scrape jobs, monitors and webhooks.

Replaces the in-memory ``JobStore`` in ``google_maps_scraper.py``, which had
two defects that this module exists to fix:

1. **No owner field.** ``list_jobs`` and ``delete_job`` authenticate the
   caller and then call ``JobStore.list_all()`` / ``delete()``, which are not
   scoped to anyone. Any valid API key could enumerate, read and delete every
   other caller's jobs. Here, ``owner`` is part of the key, so a caller
   physically cannot address another caller's record: a cross-owner ``get``
   returns ``None`` rather than being filtered after the fact.

2. **Not durable and not shared.** A process-local dict means jobs vanish on
   restart and are invisible to sibling workers -- a job created on worker 1
   returns 404 from worker 2. Records live in Redis when it is configured.

The in-memory backend remains, but only as an explicitly non-durable
development and test fallback: :meth:`RecordStore.is_durable` reports which
backend is live so callers and health checks can tell the truth about it.

Owner identity
--------------
The owner is derived from the caller's API key via HMAC-SHA256 keyed on the
application ``SECRET_KEY``. The raw key is never stored. HMAC rather than a
bare digest matters: a plain ``sha256(api_key)`` in a leaked Redis dump is
brute-forceable against a wordlist, because API keys are often short and
human-chosen. Without ``SECRET_KEY`` the digest cannot be precomputed.
