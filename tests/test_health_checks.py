"""
Regression tests for app.core.health_checks.

These lock in the Phase 4 removal of the database layer. The old
``check_database_connection`` imported SQLAlchemy and asyncpg -- neither of
which was ever declared in any requirements file -- and it ``await``-ed
``get_db()``, an async *generator*, so the healthy path could never execute.
``app/core/database.py`` and the check were deleted; these tests fail loudly
if either is reintroduced.
