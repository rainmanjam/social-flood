"""
Tests for app.core.http_client's global manager lifecycle.

The manager owns the shared httpx connection pools. get_http_client_manager()
used to build a brand new manager (and therefore a brand new pool) on every
call without ever assigning the module global, so shutdown closed exactly one
of the many pools that had been created and the rest leaked for the life of
the process.
