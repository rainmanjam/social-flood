"""End-to-end tests for the Maps jobs router -> service -> store seam.

These exist because of a bug that every other test missed.

The router was written to call ``list_jobs(owner=...)``,
``get_job_status(job_id, owner=...)`` and friends. The service still had its
pre-remediation signatures and called ``store.list_all()`` -- a method the
owner-scoped store deliberately removed, because returning every tenant's jobs
regardless of caller *was* the vulnerability. So every jobs endpoint raised
TypeError or AttributeError at runtime.

Nothing caught it. The router tests mock the service, the service tests mock
the store, and each layer is correct in isolation; only the seam between them
was broken. CodeQL found it statically (``py/call/wrong-named-argument``).

So these tests mock **only the browser** -- the one genuinely external thing --
and let the service and the store run for real.
